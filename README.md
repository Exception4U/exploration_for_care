# EXPLORE DIRECTION ESTIMATOR for ROBOTIC EXPLORATION

### Description - 
This node estimates all possible safe driveable directions for a robot given a disparity image. The safety is governed by the availability of enough gap width which can be set dynamically.

```
ExploreDirectionEstimator::setupParameters()
```

### Important features:
  - Road plane segmentation based on RANSAC (pcl plane fitting used) and hence obstacle segmentation 
  - genrates possible driveable directions for the vehicle based on available gap
  - generates grid map (not probabilistic)
